## Repository overview
This repository is structured as follows:

├── .ipynb_checkpoints
├── README
├── data
├── src
├── blog.ipynb
└── results


All data is contained in the data sub-directory, all source code is contained in src, and all output of graphs and tables is contained in results.


## Running instructions

In order to replicate all results, the following steps should be followed.
(1) Download all data contained in data sub-directory to your own environment.
(2) Run all source codes contained in src sub-directory using python3.
(3) Run blog.ipynb using python3.

This has been tested using Python 3.12.3 for windows. Within python, a number
of additional libraries are required.  These are indicated below, along with
the version number used to generate original results:
 > matplotlib 3.8.4
 > pandas 2.1.4
 > requests 2.31.0
 > BeautifulSoup 4.12.3
